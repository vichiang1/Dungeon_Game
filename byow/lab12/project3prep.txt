Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: Hexagon is the Room, tesseleations is putting rooms and hallways together

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: Probobly one to make a room of some size

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: They both enclose a space, but the room is always of width 1.

-----
Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: My code was pretty similar though it didnt have a bottom right and top right method. Instead I found start points for each collum through a seperate helper function.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: Place a Room, then choose an edge of it to add a hallway of some random size, from there add some number of random hallways and rooms to the hallway, 
repeat till some percentage of space is full while accounting for the size of the area so that nothing overlaps. (Not super fleshed out I will admit).
